Rainbow Text!
</h1>

This repository contains the source code for the extension "rainbowtext". After failing to build `i3-gaps` on my Ubuntu machine, I decided to make my own Lolcat implementation, but instead just for VS Code because it'd serve as a good way to get accquainted with the VS Code Extension system as well as a good source of Typescript practice!

## Features

This extension will simply change the color of text as you write, though it works on a half-second cooldown. So the colors will only be applied if you pause for a moment.

## Requirements

Just simply install like any other Visual Studio Code extension!

## Known Issues

Very long files and very long lines of text will eventually create lag, depending on your processor.
